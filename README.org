* Ingesting Genizah images
These are utilities for rearranging Cairo Genizah fragment image
files, recto and verso, into directories named by shelfmark, and then
compiling a csv file (a SIP) to use in ingesting them into Figgy.

Here is the process.

** Rearrange the image files
   Begin by creating a set of mock image files to play around with.
   =mock_files.rb= is a simple script; edit the /file/ and /base/
   variables to suit.

   Now, subclass the Arranger class for your data set of images.  Create
   pattern-matching rules for your image-file names.

   Test with the Arranger.rearrange method; when everything looks
   right, run Arranger.rearrange! on the actual files on the Isilon
   (you should probably make a backup of the image files first).

** Generate a SIP
   Subclass the Sipper class and, again, crreate matching rules to
   match your data.  Run Sipper.to_csv() to generate a csv.

** Perform ingest
   Use a rake task (not sure which) to ingest from the CSV.
